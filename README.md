# my-pomo-timer

I use pomodoro timers all the time, so I figured why not build my own lol

## Planning

Components:

- App
- Timer
- Calendar

Do I want a database? Could be useful for tracking the days that I did work...
Meh, that's a feature to add later, for now just focus on getting basic timer up and running

Did leetcode today... leave me alone lol

Next - add chart js functionality
